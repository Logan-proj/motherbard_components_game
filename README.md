# Motherboard Components Game

My matching game allows the user to test their knowledge of motherboard components.

## Features

Displays an image of a motherboard with numbered components. The user then assigns components to the corresponding
number on the motherboard.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a project that shows my understanding of:
+ Creating an interactive graphical user interface
+ Working with CSV files
+ Analysing data with pandas

## Requirements

+ Python3 is required to run main.py file

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project, e.g.,

	git clone https://github.com/Logan-proj/motherboard_components_game.git
	cd motherboard_components_game
	python3 main.py
